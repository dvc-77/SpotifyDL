# SPOTIFYDL
This is a simple implementation of the spotipy library. Due to limitations of the free version of Spotify(Unfortunately, I cannot afford the Premium version), this program was designed to:
* Fetch user's spotify playlist
* Search youtube for 'tracks' on the playlist
* Download 'tracks' to local storage

## GETTING STARTED

As well as, development and testing purposes.
